# Civizen documentation

Documentation is organized by **purpose and subject**, not by moderation lane or development stage.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `draft` | Work in progress; not adopted |
| `under-review` | Submitted for review |
| `accepted` | Formally accepted; may not yet be operational |
| `current` | Active / controlling for its domain |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a newer document; kept for history |
| `historical` | Completed implementation or phase record |
| `unknown` | Status not established from repository evidence |

Working institutional and platform documents also use **display** labels that map onto this vocabulary without requiring a mass retag:

| Display label | Typical YAML `status` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Working** | `draft` | Authoritative project design direction; not adopted public policy |
| **Proposed** | `draft` | Named structure or rule not yet formed or adopted |
| **Adopted** | `current` / `accepted` | Controlling public or operational instrument |
| **Experimental** | `draft` | Trial design; not controlling |
| **Current** | `current` | In-force for that domain until a successor is adopted |
| **Historical** / **Superseded** | `historical` / `superseded` | Kept for continuity |

Do not treat `canonical: true` as “permanently immutable.” Canonical means the single editable source for the topic **as it currently stands**.

Substantive documents may include YAML front matter (`title`, `status`, `version`, `owners`, `last_reviewed`, `canonical`). Fields are omitted or set to `unknown` when evidence is missing. Do not invent owners or approval dates.

**Canonical** (`canonical: true`) means this is the single editable source for that topic. Prefer linking to canonical paths; do not maintain a second editable copy.

## Proposing documentation changes

1. Open a draft under [`proposals/drafts/`](./proposals/drafts/) (or edit an existing draft).
2. When ready for review, move or label it `under-review`.
3. After acceptance, place the canonical copy in the appropriate numbered section and leave a link from related indexes—do not maintain two editable copies.
4. Superseded material moves to [`archive/superseded/`](./archive/superseded/) with a short header pointing to the replacement.

Migration inventory: [`archive/implementation-history/docs-ia-migration-inventory-2026-08-10.md`](./archive/implementation-history/docs-ia-migration-inventory-2026-08-10.md).

Legacy moderation-lane paths and top-level redirect stubs were removed after confirming no published URL or application import depended on them. History remains in git and in the migration inventory.
