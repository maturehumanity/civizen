**For a Mature Humanity**

Civizen is a live civic network for voluntary world citizenship, civic learning, trusted participation, governance, cooperation, and the practical development of the Mature Humanity vision.

Today, Civizen is a voluntary, non-governmental platform and does not claim state authority, territorial jurisdiction, or government-recognized citizenship.

Its long-term purpose is to unite people as citizens of humanity and help build the democratic, institutional, technological, and legal foundations through which a complementary, recognized form of planetary citizenship may one day become possible. See the [recognized planetary citizenship pathway](https://civizen.world/about/planetary-citizenship-pathway).

**Try it:** [civizen.world](https://civizen.world)

## Why it exists

Humanity lacks a shared civic layer for cooperation across borders — auditable systems that prevent fraud and related harms — while divided institutions often reward rivalry over common interest. Civizen exists to build that complementary layer for world citizenship: software where people can create a Civizen profile, learn shared civic rules, take part in governance within current network scope, and cooperate economically with prototype tools — without depending on a closed proprietary platform, and without claiming that Civizen currently replaces lawful institutions.

It is developed with an open-source orientation and meant to be audited in public, with a staged path toward broader distributed stewardship. Rights to use each component are governed only by the license expressly included with that component.

The longer destination is documented in [From Voluntary World Citizenship to Recognized Planetary Citizenship](/about/planetary-citizenship-pathway).

## What you can do today

Civizen is early access, but already usable:

- **World Citizen profile** — voluntary Civizen profile, trust signals, endorsements (not a government identity)  
- **Study** — Constitution and civic learning paths  
- **Governance** — proposals, audits, and community process within Civizen scope  
- **Market & agreements** — listings and digital agreements; Luma appears only as non-transferable prototype credits for demonstration (does not settle transactions; not money or a financial product)  
- **Messaging** — in-network communication  

Coming next includes broader federation, insurance modules, and iPhone distribution.

### Technical direction (short)

Local-first identity (DIDs), sync and storage toward P2P/decentralized backends, community governance of upgrades, and a staged path from testing builds to production. Deep architecture notes live under `docs/` — start with [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md) and [Sovereign Architecture](./docs/SOVEREIGN_CIVIZEN_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Project conventions

- **Feature registry:** `src/lib/feature-registry.ts` — update registry and Features-page copy together  
- **Autosave** is the default for editable app pages  
- **Android publish:** `npm run update:application` · **iOS:** `npm run cap:ios`  
- Ops / release notes: `docs/04-operations/dev/`

### Contributing

Propose changes through the project’s governance process when possible; for code, open a clear PR against `main` with a short why. Prefer small, reviewable diffs.
